# Python_Numpy
Join me in learning more fundamentals of python and the numpy library =)

This project consists of a Google Colab notebook filling done concurrently with the classes of the course Python for Data Science: Language and Numpy, taught by instructor Rodrigo Fernando Dias from Alura.

In this project I had one of my first contacts with the Numpy library. In it we imported data in .txt mode and manipulated it using numpy.

I learned mathematical operations and expressions, variable manipulation, data types and how to convert them, indentation, comments and string formatting, working with lists, repeat and conditional structures, and numpy basics.

With numpy I had contact with arrays and the possible ways to manipulate them, such as arithmetic operations, selections, attributes and methods, and statistics.

All this very well documented in the notebook above =)
